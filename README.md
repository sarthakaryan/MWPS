# Enhancing Math Word Problem Solving with Machine Learning and NLP
## INTRODUCTION
A Math Word - Problem (MWP) or an Arithmetic - Word Problem is any mathematical exercise that employs plain language to convey the premise of the problem with important background knowledge and pose a question based on it, rather than mathematical notations. Natural languages are commonly used languages such as English, French,Hindi , Spanish, and any other language. In this paper, we only focus on maths word-problems in English which contain a single variable and additionally can also contain multiple operators ,at the elementary school level. Automatic MWP solving is a task that mainly focuses on processing the problem’s natural language semantically in order to generate an equation that can reflect any word-problem accurately, which can then be solved to get the required answer. Even though the human brain gets more competent at
handling all of these various problems as they mature,the learning experiences make it quiet difficult for any of the systems to handle even simpllest of problems like addition,multiplication,division,or subtraction. While the computer has demonstrated that it can perform mathematical computations faster and more correctly than a human it is unable to translate and analyze information written in distinct
human understandable languages or natural languages. One of the open research areas in the domains of Machine Learning ( ML ) , AI , and also Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) is the development of a computational system that can be tailored to suit different human cognitive vantage points in order to respond to mathematical word problems and produce accurate equations and results.

To address these issues and in order to enhance the effectiveness and the accuracy of word problem resolution,this study provides a unique approach that makes use of Random
Forest’s capabilities. Random Forest is a powerful and adaptable ML algorithm. The key objective of the project is constructing a word problem solver based on NLP and
Machine learning that can automatically decipher and extract key information from word problems containing multiple
operators thereby enabling accurate mathematical equation generation and subsequent solution creation.
